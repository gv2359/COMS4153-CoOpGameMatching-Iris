## Iris: Co-Op Game Matching Gateway

The UI service interacts solely with Iris, which then connects to the MatchService, NotificationService, and UserValidationService. This architecture streamlines user interactions and ensures efficient communication between services, enabling a seamless experience for gamers seeking partners for two-player cooperative games.
